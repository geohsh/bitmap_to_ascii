# bitmap_to_ascii

This is a small C program that converts bitmap (BMP) files to asii arts (eg. txt file)

Note #1: Works terriblely with photographs, but amazingly good with anime pictures (idk why...)
Note #2: When you are reading examples, if possible, please open the file in another page and make the font smaller...
